                            <p>My product design background comes from working in fields such as medical technology, branding and web design. I have a vast range of skills in digital design and Iâ€™m constantly immersing myself in the current climate of product design by listening to podcasts and reading the latest developments.</p>

                            <p>I started my career in design as an Industrial Designer, working on technical hardware projects in a range of fields. I discovered the joy of UX and UI design through the intersection of interfaces on medical instruments. I still practice some hardware design as well as applying that skillset to furniture design and manufacturing.</p>
